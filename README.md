# Speedrun Tool for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.
A program to allow a more user-friendly way to fix track RNG for Monster Hunter World speedrunning.

## Setup
The application will attempt to locate your Monster Hunter World install folder automatically. If it fails, you will be asked to manually enter it.
If your install location changes for any reason, you can update the program's stored path via either the "Locate MHW Folder" to have the program attempt to automatically locate it, or the "Input MHW Folder" button if you want to manually input your new folder path.

## Usage
For any monster that you want to fix the track RNG for, simply select the pattern you want from the appropriate dropdown, then click "Load to NativePC" once you've selected all the patterns you want.

Currently, the program does not save the track patterns you've loaded on restart. However, when you load a set of patterns they will stay loaded in your `nativePC` folder until the next time you press "Load to NativePC", so once you load the patterns you want once, you no longer need to use this program unless you want to change them.

## Planned features

- Save management
- Fixed Tracks
- nativePC legality verification
